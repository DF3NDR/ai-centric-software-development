# The AI-Centric Software Development Playbook

A practitioner's guide to building software in the age of AI — designed for small, highly capable teams that leverage AI tools to deliver what large organizations once required.

## 📖 About This Repository

This repository contains a comprehensive series of articles that establish a methodology for modern software development in which small teams (1–5 people) orchestrate AI tools to perform specialist-level work across every discipline. These are **living documents** — continuously refined and updated as the field evolves and new practices emerge.

**Timeline Thesis:** 18–24 months before this approach is fully operational for teams on the leading edge.

**Core Philosophy:** This is not about replacing engineers. It's about multiplying the leverage of skilled practitioners by giving them orchestration tools — prompts, skills, instruction sets, MCP servers, custom AIs — that compress what large teams once did into small, highly capable units. The fundamentals of computer science, architecture, and design thinking remain essential. What changes is the *interface* through which that knowledge is applied.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

This playbook covers the complete software development lifecycle through an AI-centric lens:

- **Specification Driven Development (SDD)** — An iterative, specification-first methodology that forms the engine of the framework
- **Core Principles** — Six guiding principles (Security, Maintainability, Economics, Operations, Scoring & Metrics, Correctness Verification) that travel with you through every phase
- **Tool Sets** — Curated combinations of prompts, skills, MCP servers, instructions, and resources assembled for specific purposes
- **Practical Application** — How to apply these concepts across every phase from information gathering through deployment and evolution

## 📚 The Articles

### [Article 0: Manifesto — Small Teams, Big AI, New Paradigm](articles/article-00-manifesto.md)
The foundational vision. Why AI is reshaping what engineers do, why small teams will dominate, what changes and what doesn't, and what this series provides.

### [Article 1: Core Principles — Your Compass for Every Decision](articles/article-01-core-principles.md)
The six principles that guide every decision at every phase:
- **Security** — Threat modeling, zero-trust design, continuous audit hooks, compliance preparation
- **Maintainability** — Testing strategy, documentation, technical debt control, observability
- **Economics** — Cost forecasting, speed-to-market, resource scaling
- **Operations** — Scalability, reliability, interoperability, governance
- **Scoring & Metrics** — Measurable outcomes for every principle
- **Correctness Verification** — Formal verification, automated checks, specification conformance

### [Article 2: Building Your Toolkit — Tool Sets, SDD, and the Building Blocks](articles/article-02-building-your-toolkit.md)
How to assemble your AI-centric development toolkit:
- The foundation: consolidated knowledge resources
- Types of building blocks (prompts, skills, instruction sets, MCP servers, custom AIs)
- Tool sets — curated combinations for specific purposes
- Specification Driven Development (SDD) — the methodology that drives everything

### [Article 3: Information Gathering — Starting with the Right Questions](articles/article-03-information-gathering.md)
The first phase: understanding what you're building and why. Interview prompts, stakeholder mapping, and establishing the foundation for specifications.

### [Article 4: Analysis & Stack Selection — Making Architectural Decisions](articles/article-04-analysis-stack-selection.md)
Evaluating options, selecting technologies, and making foundational architectural decisions with AI assistance while applying Core Principles.

### [Article 5: Design & Technical Analysis — From Concept to Specification](articles/article-05-design-technical-analysis.md)
Creating detailed specifications, data models, API designs, and architectural blueprints that will drive implementation.

### [Article 6: Architecture & Modular Design — Building for Scale and Change](articles/article-06-architecture-modular-design.md)
Designing systems that are modular, testable, maintainable, and aligned with your Core Principles from day one.

### [Article 7: Implementation — From Specification to Working Code](articles/article-07-implementation.md)
How AI-augmented implementation works in practice: generating code, reviewing output, maintaining quality, and keeping principles front and center.

### [Article 8: Testing & Audit — Verifying Correctness at Every Level](articles/article-08-testing-audit.md)
Comprehensive testing strategies, correctness verification, security audits, and ensuring your system meets its specifications.

### [Article 9: Deployment & Evolution — Launch, Learn, and Iterate](articles/article-09-deployment-evolution.md)
Taking systems to production and maintaining them over time. Monitoring, scaling, evolving, and keeping the feedback loop tight.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### Specification Driven Development (SDD)

The iterative, specification-first workflow that powers the AI-centric approach:

1. **Interview prompts** gather needs and context
2. A **plan document** is produced and broken into sections or epics
3. Each section is specified through a detailed **Project Requirement Document (PRD)**
4. The PRD drives a well-defined **task list**
5. **Implementation prompts** produce results

This SDD cycle runs continuously across all phases, with Core Principles evaluated at every step.

### The Toolkit Philosophy

**Principles First, Then Tools** — Every building block in your toolkit (prompts, skills, MCP servers) should be evaluated against the six Core Principles. If a tool accelerates development but undermines a principle, it doesn't belong.

**Building Blocks Organized into Tool Sets** — Individual components are curated into purposeful combinations designed for specific phases and tasks within the SDD cycle.

**Consolidated Knowledge as Foundation** — Your team's existing knowledge (documentation, references, standards, past decisions) becomes the foundation that AI draws from, not just its training data.
